                <p> Throughout the years, food in Korea Town has flourished and adapted from other types of food due to its diverse
                    population which has brought about the creation of fusion foods.These include, Korean-Colombian, Korean-Mexican,
                    Korean American, and other types of fusions, all derived from Korean food and a different type of food.
                    Food has grown not only to satisfy our culinary needs, but also the need to bring people and families
                    to a place where they can relax and be with one another.

                Food culture has also allowed people to bond with one another over food. Food Culture plays a big role in out current society
                due to the fact that social media has been a place where people can share their creations and differen types
                of fusion food. It highlights places such as KoreaTown because of its diversity in food.

    <h1>Gentrification and the effects on Ktowns Culture</h1>
    </center>
    <div class="MaPawagwaphs">
        <div id="BwackGwound">This year on February 9th, The los Angeles city council approved the K-town project, this project is supposed to
            bring about the creation of 52+ new buildings. These buildings will be finished by 2020 if all goes according
            to plan. The Korea town project may sound like a good thing to most people but this will actually increase prices
            by the hundreds and maybe even thousands, not only that but it will kick our communties out of their homes. This
            will also bring the loss of the culture and the loss of our food which we have taken so long to develop in our
            homes here in K-town.</div>

            Near my home and most likely near yours there are many different buildings that are being planned for demolition
            and leasing. Your favorite mom and pops resturaunt will be be turned into another Mc.Donalds and your friends
            home will be turned into a galleria or another big corporate store. Soon enough even you will be forced to evict
            your home and move into a different neighborhood and lose everything that you had worked so hard to build.</div>

    <div>
            food has been a way that we, over centuries, have used to connect with each other. We used food as a bridge to connect
            and inspire each other. Our food is a window that allowed people to see what we are, and through that we inspired
            people to break out of their mold and try new things. Outside of their culture and their religious bonds. We
            most likely made friends and bonded with others over the love of the same food, food that changed us as people
            and food that we grew up with. Imagine the resturaunt that you grew up with, the place where you took your siginificant
            other. Imagine all that being destroyed.</div>
